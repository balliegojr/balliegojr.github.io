I Write code, usually in Rust, some times it works...
---

I have been writing code for a long time now, long enough to write a decade and put plus after it (10+ years).

My first years started with .NET, at the time I was young and naive and I had a MS coffe mug and a pillow cover - ok, I actually didn't have those stuff, but I had a very strong belief that C# and MSDN were the best things in the world. Nothing like everything being controlled by a single giant corp. But to be fair, C# is a pretty decent language.

Then I discovered JS and Python and the wonderful world of open source, and started to used linux, grew a beard - and a belly, but that was due to long night hours at work with nothing but pizza and Mc Donalds as food. After around four years getting shot in the foot because JS is such a well design and bugfree language, I decided it was time to move on.

It was time to look for something else. I have tried elixir for a while, I was deep in love with it's functional approach and the fairly sane sintax, but almost nobody uses elixir - and a man needs to eat - so it wasn't a good choice for a _main_ language. In my search for something new, for a brief moment of insanity I turned my eyes towards Go, and it took me two days to realize that I hated it. 

It was then that I first came across with one of the "We re-wrote it in Rust and it is blazingly fast" blog posts. And I was bit by the crab. I haven't looked for anything else since then.
